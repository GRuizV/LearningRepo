'Using .__slots__ to lightweight classes'

#         self.x = x
#         self.y = y


# point1 = Point1(4, 8)

# print(asizeof.asizeof(point1))  # 504 bytes of memory being used

# point1.z = 5

#     def __init__(self, x, y):

#         self.x = x
#         self.y = y


# point2 = Point2(4, 8)

# # print(point2.__dict__)  # Now that .__slosts__ is defined, 'Point2' object has no attribute '__dict__' error popped

# print(asizeof.asizeof(point2))  # 112 bytes of memory being used, significantly less


# point2.z = 5

# # print(point2.z) # The use of __slots__ does not allow dynamically create attributes /: 'Point2' object has no attribute 'z' error popped


'''
    Warning: 
        A word of caution is in order, as many of Python's built-in mechanisms implicitly assume that objects have the .__dict__ attribute. 
        When you use .__slots__(), then you waive that assumption, which means that some of those mechanisms might not work as expected anymore.

'Making a Class an Iterable'

# class Point:

#     def __iter__(self): # The .__iter__() method is a generator function that returns an iterator
#         yield from (self.x, self.y)



# print(list(Point(4, 8)))    # [4,8] / The call to list() iterates over the attributes .x, .y, and .z, returning a list object. You donâ€™t need to call .__iter__() directly.

'MRO: Method Resolution Order'

    If a Class inherits from different Classes that provides implementations
    for the same method, which method the child class will use?
